 NOTE: The latest code in Emacs source tree
 <http://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/lh/emacs/> supports
 multiple package repositories. The code *does* not work in erlier
 versions of Emacs (required tabular-list.el which depends on
 new glyph features).
Description: Emacs lisp package archive, old version (<Emacs 24 ELPA)
  An interface to Emacs Lisp Package Archive (ELPA) at
 <http://tromey.com/elpa>. A package is described by its name and
 version. The distribution format is either a tar file or a single
 *.el file.
 .
 A tar file should be named NAME-VERSION.tar. The tar file must
 unpack into a directory named after the package and version:
 NAME-VERSION. It must contain a file named PACKAGE-pkg.el which
 consists of a call to define-package. It may also contain a "dir"
 file and the info files it references.
 .
 A *.el file will be named NAME-VERSION.el in ELPA, but will be
 installed as simply NAME.el in a directory named NAME-VERSION.
 .
 Start interface with M-x package-list-packages or
 M-x package-list-packages-no-fetch
 .
 NOTE: Included in Emacs 24. This old version does not support
 multiple package repositories.
